# Limited Face-to-Face LMS

## About the Project
The project involves developing a Limited Face-to-Face Learning Management System for a fictional elementary school to manage student attendance during the fluctuating Covid-19 pandemic.
The system aims to handle various administrative and operational aspects of limited face-to-face learning, ensuring adherence to government-imposed community activity restrictions.
The system ensures that only vaccinated students can participate in face-to-face learning while maintaining controlled class capacities and attendance schedules.
Here are the five roles in the system and their features:

1. System Administrator: Managing rooms, teachers, students, classes, learning periods, and account details.
2. Principal: Monitoring recapitulation and trend analysis of learning periods.
3. Teacher: Viewing teaching schedules, class details, and student lists for each period.
4. Student: Logging in, updating vaccination status, selecting learning periods, and managing attendance preferences.
5. Security: Checking student registration status for entry approval.

> This is the final project for the "Web Programming" and "Information Management and Database" course.
